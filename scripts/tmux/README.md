These are my tmux scripts.

# Keybinds

I prefer to stick with a cli type interface as one can usue through a teletype, 
but some keybinds are worth learning with the following justifications. 

## Scrolling

Imagine this as pulling up paper to look at previous output.

- `ctrl-b + [` and navigate with arrow keys.
- `q` to exit scrolling mode.

## Navigating Through Windows and Panes

Imagine this as cutting out sheets of paper from the teletype flow and placing 
them around the room as you work.

- `ctrl-b + %` to split a pane into two horizontally.
- `ctrl-b + "` to split a pane into two vertically. 
- `ctrl-b + q` followed by number to change to pane inside a window.
- `ctrl-b + c` to create a new window.
- `ctrl-b + '` and enter window number to change to that window.
