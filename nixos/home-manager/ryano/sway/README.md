## Basics

- `man -k sway` is where to find documentation. There isn't much online.
- `cat ~/.config/sway/config` is where home manager places the initial config. 
  Make sure to not edit this file, but the home manager entry instead. Just use
  the config file as a reference when you forget a keybind. 

## Keybinds

In my case, `mod` is the windows key on my keyboard.

### NOT CORRECT AT THIS TIME

I did this while looking at i3 documentation. I need to look at the 
new config file and adjust. Also I must have been tired while doing 
this because even for i3 I think it's wrong lmfao.

- `mod + enter` to create a new terminal.
- `mod + v` to have windows split vertically.
- `mod + h` to have windows split horizontally.
- `mod + e` to toggle horizontal and vertical window splits.
- `mod + w` to toggle window to tab splits.
- `mod + hjkl` like vi to navigate windows.
- `mod + d` to open a search bar for programs.
