`man sway` is the primary place to find useful documentation.
In my case, `mod` is the windows key on my keyboard.

- `mod + enter` to create a new terminal.
- `mod + v` to have windows split vertically.
- `mod + h` to have windows split horizontally.
- `mod + e` to toggle horizontal and vertical window splits.
- `mod + w` to toggle window to tab splits.
- `mod + hjkl` like vi to navigate windows.
- `mod + d` to open a search bar for programs.
