# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm building a knowledge base.

File paths are relative to the root of this repo.

You'll need my pass phrase for my encryption scripts. Store it in 
`../pass_phrase`. To use the push script you need a github fine 
grained personal access token (see https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
which you then store in `../token`. Both filepaths just lead to textfiles that I don't put `.txt` on.
Just `touch <file>`, `vi <file>`, and get to it :). 

# Software I'm Using

I enjoy a unix approach to text editing.

## vi

I just use the modal text editor in a terminal. So the exact package I might be using 
at any time doesn't matter. 

I'm happy using either of the following:
- https://www.vim.org/
- https://neovim.io/

I'm also happy just typing vi in whatever available terminal and hoping for the best!

At the moment, I'm on a fedora machine using the vi command which just runs vim 
with $VIM_POSIX=1 in my ~/.bashrc in order to keep the editor lean and mean.

# A note on AI

Besides artifacts from the autogenerated README.md, the license, and copy pasting 
URL's. Everything here is made by me using a specific set of tools and methods 
for using them that I'll write out in further detail later. That list 
currently does not contain and will never contain an LLM or use of an LLM of any 
sort since I consider their usage outside of research to be a hindrance to human 
learning.
