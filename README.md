# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm building a knowledge base.

# Requirements

- A Terminal Emulator capable of running 
  [dash](https://packages.debian.org/sid/dash) scripts.
  
  + Every other requirement must be accessible by the shell in this terminal 
    emulator.
  
  + It needs to support unicode characters.

  + For example:  Foot, Alacritty, Kitty, or WezTerm with a nerdfont is 
    sufficient. I personally use [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) and 
    [BigBlueTerm Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
  
- [podman](https://podman.io/)
  
- A `secrets.env` file of the following form:
  
  + ```
    TOKEN=<Your fine grained personal access token which allows you to push up to github>
    PASS_PHRASE=<The pass phrase you use to decrypt the project planning document>
    ```
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
  
  + You should be able to clone repositories from github.

# Installation

- Configure the required software to your liking. An example can be found in 
  `scripts/foot/deploy_config.sh`.  
- `git clone https://github.com/RyanOatmeal/RyanOatmeal.git` in the same 
  directory that `secrets.env` lives.
- `cd RyanOatmeal` 
- `dash scripts/environment/install.sh`

## Uninstall 

`dash scripts/environment/uninstall.sh` will remove the images and containers 
made from the installation.


# Use 

- `dash scripts/environment/start.sh` to start the podman container.
- `dash scripts/environment/stop.sh` to stop the podman container.
- `dash scripts/environment/enter.sh` to enter the environment. Note 
  that the podman container must be up (i.e. you should have ran the start
  script at some point) for this command to work.

# Software I'm Using (MIGRATING TO PODMAN AND GUIX MANIFEST FILES)

See `notes/software_i_am_using.md`.

# A note on AI

Besides artifacts from the autogenerated README.md, the license, and copy 
pasting URL's which I only use for linking out, everything here is made by me 
using a specific set of tools and methods for using them that I'll write out in 
further detail later. That list currently does not contain and will never 
contain an LLM or use of an LLM of any sort since I consider their use
outside of research/conversation to be a hindrance to human learning.
