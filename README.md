# Hi there!

This is my computer "base" where I keep a specification of my tech stack in 
the form of a set of nixos files and sh helper scripts. I run everything here on
a ThinkPad T16. 

# Requirements

- A `../secrets.env` file of the following form:
  
  + ```
    TOKEN=<Your fine grained personal access token which allows you to push up to github>
    PASS_PHRASE=<The pass phrase you use to decrypt the project planning document>
    ```
- My [nixos](https://nixos.org/) configuration found in `./programs/nixos` running
  as the user's operating system.

# Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/RyanOatmeal/RyanOatmeal.git` 
- `cd RyanOatmeal` 
- `dash programs/sh/git/deploy_hooks.sh` for important pre-commit hooks.

## Uninstall 

Just delete the repository and `../secrets.env`.

# Use

- **From the root directory of the repository:** `dash programs/sh/<folder for collection of commands>/<command>.sh` 
- tmux snippets found in `programs/nixos/home-manager/ryano/tmux/definition.nix`

# Licensing

# Provenance

Everything you find in this repository has been filtered through the images, 
voice, or procedural thought in the mind of the sole human writing
commits that goes by the name Ryan Oatmeal. There is no other intelligence like
a large language model making changes or steering the direction of this project.

We stand on the shoulders of giants, and so at times the author converses with both
humans and large language models for advice. While conversing with an LLM is a novel
activity in the past few years, it's not much different than reading forums like 
stackexchange and using suggestions made by users there. 

Note: By procedural thought, the author means that one might find artifacts 
which were generated by an algorithm that the author could fully understand
at the time of writing it and have a form that could be 
described in an arbitrary amount of detail by the author before it was generated.
