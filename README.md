I enjoy a unix approach to text editing.

## vi

I just use the modal text editor in a terminal. So the exact package I might be using 
at any time doesn't matter. 

I'm happy using either of the following:
- https://www.vim.org/
- https://neovim.io/

I'm also happy just typing vi in whatever available terminal and hoping for the best!

At the moment, I'm on a fedora machine using the vi command which just runs vim 
with $VIM_POSIX=1 in my ~/.bashrc in order to keep the editor lean and mean.

Besides artifacts from the autogenerated README.md and the license. Everything here is made by me using a 
specific set of tools and methods for using them that I'll write out in further detail later. That list 
currently does not contain and will never contain an LLM or use of an LLM of any sort since I consider their 
usage outside of research to be a hindrance to human learning.
