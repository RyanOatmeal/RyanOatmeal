## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm building a knowledge base. 

## Software I'm Using

### vi

I just use the modal text editor in a terminal. So the exact package I might be using 
at any time doesn't matter. 
I'm happy usuing any of the following:
- https://www.vim.org/
- https://neovim.io/
- https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ with evil mode enabled
- https://code.visualstudio.com/ with the vim plugin
- and so on...

### tmux

- https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki

### Bash

- https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/

### Coreutils

- https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/

## A note on AI

Besides artifacts from the autogenerated README.md and the license. Everything here is made by me using a 
specific set of tools and methods for using them that I'll write out in further detail later. That list 
currently does not contain and will never contain an LLM or use of an LLM of any sort since I consider their 
usage outside of research to be a hindrance to human learning.
