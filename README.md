# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm building a knowledge base. 

# Use

- File paths are relative to the root of this repo.
- Before doing anything, run `sh scripts/install.sh`.
- You'll need my pass phrase for my encryption scripts. Store it in `../pass_phrase`. 
- To use the push script you need a github fine grained personal access token for this repo
  (see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens))
  which you then store in `../token`. 
Note: The two previous filepaths just lead to text files that I don't append `.txt` to the end of. 
      Simply run `touch <file path>`, `vi <file path>`, and get to it :).

# A note on AI

Besides artifacts from the autogenerated README.md, the license, and copy pasting 
URL's. Everything here is made by me using a specific set of tools and methods 
for using them that I'll write out in further detail later. That list 
currently does not contain and will never contain an LLM or use of an LLM of any 
sort since I consider their usage outside of research to be a hindrance to human 
learning.
