Anything found in this directory came from the voice in my head and nothing 
more using the following methods and tools:

1. Typed on a keyboard: 
   - Using only my fingers.
   - Where any combination of key presses either 
     + Generates one character in one file at any location.
     + Deletes an arbitrary number of characters at any location in any file.
     + Adds an arbitrary number of spaces and newlines at any location in any file.
2. Copying and pasting from transcriptions of recordings of only my voice that only 
   came from my mouth (I like to walk and think out loud :-) ). 
3. Copying and pasting from a source that was created using the methods and
   tools of #1 and #2.
