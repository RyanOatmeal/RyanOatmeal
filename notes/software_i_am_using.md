# Software I'm Using

This is mostly a reference for me to know what to install if I have to migrate
systems but I intend for this to be expanded into a document that also details
exactly how I use all of these tools in the near future.

## Text Editing

I enjoy a terminal based, unix style approach.

### vi

I just use the modal text editor in a terminal. So the exact package I might be using 
at any time doesn't matter. 

I'm happy using either of the following:
- https://www.vim.org/
- https://neovim.io/

I'm also happy just typing vi in whatever available terminal and hoping for the best!

At the moment, I'm on a fedora machine using the vi command which just runs vim 
with $VIM_POSIX=1 in my ~/.bashrc in order to keep the editor lean and mean. 
See https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/23008/posix-compliant-vi-implementations

### grep

https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/

### sed

https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/

### awk

I use the following with the `--posix` flag:

See the following for information about `--posix`:
