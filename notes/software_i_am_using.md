# Software I'm Using

I enjoy a unix style approach to text editing.

## vi

I just use the modal text editor in a terminal. So the exact package I might be using 
at any time doesn't matter. 

I'm happy using either of the following:
- https://www.vim.org/
- https://neovim.io/

I'm also happy just typing vi in whatever available terminal and hoping for the best!

At the moment, I'm on a fedora machine using the vi command which just runs vim 
with $VIM_POSIX=1 in my ~/.bashrc in order to keep the editor lean and mean.
